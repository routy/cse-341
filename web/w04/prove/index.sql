/**

- This system must track notes for multiple users.

- The speakers should be tracked separately from the conference because one speaker will speak at multiple conferences.

- Individual sessions of conference (e.g., Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon) need not be tracked, rather simply the year and month, (e.g., April 2009, Oct 2012).

- You need not account for the fact that some speakers will speak multiple times at a conference, but assume that a note can be tied to a "speaker + conference."

- Multiple notes can be added by the same user about a single conference talk.
